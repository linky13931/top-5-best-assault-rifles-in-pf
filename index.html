    <li>HK416. History
        The HK416 is an assault rifle developed by German firearms manufacturer Heckler & Koch based on the AR-15 series of rifles, specifically the Colt M4 carbine family. During the 1990s, the United States Army Delta Force, in collaboration with Heckler & Koch and American firearms expert Larry Vickers, began development of a new rifle to replace the M4 carbine, with the goal to fix the issues with the M16 and M4 designs. Heckler & Koch used their prior experience in developing the G36 rifle - and later during development, the XM8 project - and their successful modernization program of the British SA80 series of weapons in designing the HK416.
        
        The HK416 uses a proprietary short-stroke gas piston originally used in the G36 which was developed off the Armalite AR-18.​[1] This new piston system prevents combustion gases getting inside the weapon and remove any powder residue being in the receiver after long periods of shooting, greatly improving reliability by reducing instances of malfunctions and improving the lifespan of weapon parts.[1][2] Other improvements include a cold hammer forged barrel, an improved bolt and a free-floating hand guard with standard Picatinny rails.
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The HK416 possesses above-average damage for its class. Although it has a four-shot kill (4SK) up close and a 5SK at the end of its damage drop-off, its damage values are high enough that one headshot will reduce the shots to kill (STK) requirements by one at any range. Range is very good, with damage beginning to drop off at 80 studs, an average for its class—however, it stops at 160 studs, which is a good minimum range value for an assault rifle.
        
        Rate of fire (RoF) is on the higher end for its class, at 850 RPM—identical to the TAR-21 and only slightly slower than that of the FAMAS G2 or AS VAL. Muzzle velocity is average for its class, at 2500 studs per second. With average damage, muzzle velocity and higher-than-average RoF, this results in the HK416's time to kill (TTK) being fairly good quick close and consistent at medium range.
        
        Recoil is overall mixed. Recoil per shot is mild and vertical recoil is fairly moderate. However, camera recoil is quite high, with a high degree of horizontal kick. Hipfire is average for its class, with average spread, although the higher RoF makes hipfire performance somewhat better than other assault rifles.
        
        Magazine capacity is average for its class, at 30+1 rounds, with 120 rounds in reserve - also average for its class. Reload times are on the slower end, requiring 2.7 seconds for a tactical reload and 3.1 seconds for an empty reload. Due to the higher RoF, the HK416's ammunition consumption rate is quite high. Fortunately, as an assault rifle, along with a common ammunition type (5.56x45mm NATO), the HK416 can replenish its ammunition stocks relatively easily.
        
        Usage & Tactics
        The HK416 is a competitive assault rifle within the close range to medium range bracket. Its high RoF coupled with its good damage and range makes it a fast-killing weapon, even out to medium range. For reference, its TTK falls in between the M16A3 and the FAMAS G2, and is quite comparable to the TAR-21 and personal defense weapons such as the MP10, which have identical firerates and shots to kill (STK) profiles, albeit differing ranges and muzzle velocities. The HK416 does remain outclassed in CQC by the likes of faster-firing or higher damage weapons, such as the AS VAL, M231 and FAMAS G2—the HK416 trades better CQC performance for better overall range performance and versatility, being able to perform at multiple range engagements fairly well, but remaining marginally outclassed in some aspects by other weapons.
        
        The main downsides of the HK416 are its recoil, high ammunition consumption rate and slow reload times. Its high camera recoil makes it hard to remain on target whilst firing in full-auto outside of close range, making tap-firing or burst-firing useful for longer-ranged engagements. Given the recoil's effect on accuracy, this can also affect the rate of ammunition consumption—the less accurate a weapon is, the likelihood of more bullets being expended at shooting at a target for a kill increases. Thankfully, the common ammunition type allows ammunition reserves to be easily replenished, thus a user will typically not run completely dry. The more important issue of the HK416 is that the high ammunition consumption rate leads to more time wasted for reloading. This is compounded by the HK416's slow reload times, as the longer duration required to complete a reload leaves the user to enemy attacks without being able to retaliate for much longer. This can be mitigated by finding cover before reloading to reduce the risk of being shot at, along with ammunition conservation by firing in long bursts where possible.
        
        Regarding attachments, the HK416 is a fairly versatile weapon, much like all other AR-15 style rifles. With optics, its iron sights are quite clear and useful for CQC and medium range, so an optic is not necessarily essential but they do provide a marginal benefit in terms of precision. Most of the higher-magnification optics remain less effective on the HK416 given the high camera recoil and the weapon being suited towards closer ranges, so low-magnification, single dot optics such as the Delta Sight or the Reflex Sight are good choices. In terms of barrel attachments, the Compensator is a good choice to mitigate the horizontal recoil of the weapon and make it easier to remain on target whilst firing in full-auto. Suppressors are also quite useable, if the user is comfortable with the recoil, as they will not affect the STK requirement to the body, making the HK416 a good candidate for a stealth-based loadout. However, suppressors will make headshots more crucial in reducing the TTK at longer ranges. Additionally, if on a CQC heavy map, the Muzzle Booster attachment makes the weapon fire at a very high 918 RPM; this combined with its above-average damage, makes it a very powerful CQC weapon while still possessing good mid to long range capabilities. Recoil does increase slightly so the user must be careful to compensate if using this attachment.
        
        As for underbarrel attachments, the Stubby Grip is a very good choice, reducing the recoil and making the weapon more stable when firing in full-auto, subsequently improving the weapon's useability at medium ranges. Alternatively, if the user is strictly using the HK416 up close, a Vertical Grip greatly improves the hipfire performance of the weapon. Alternatively, the user could use the Angled Grip to greatly reduce the camera recoil. With auxiliary attachments, a laser sight is highly recommended. The benefit of tighter hipfire spread is always useful and when paired with a vertical grip and suppressor makes for a very good CQC-orientated loadout, taking advantage of the HK416's higher RoF.
        
        Conclusion
        The HK416 is a great candidate when it comes to flanking and preying on targets as its fast TTK will let the user kill their target before they have a chance to retaliate in most circumstances. But in a hotly contested area, its reload time will leave a user vulnerable. Its customizability also allows the user to use the HK416 in differing roles and varied situations whilst remaining a competitive weapon.</li> <img src="https://www.vhv.rs/dpng/d/225-2250613_hk416-phantom-forces-wiki-fandom-powered-by-wikia.png" width=500 height=300>

    <li>M231. History
        The M231 FPW (Firing Port Weapon) is an open bolt firearm and was designed for the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The Rock Island Arsenal worked with the World War 2-era M3 submachine gun, another FPW based on the HK33, and an adapted AR-15/M16-pattern weapon before deciding that the last weapon had promising qualities and was given the designation XM231. Colt was given the contract for the weapon and continued working on the design, and the weapon was finalized in 1979 and adopted as the M231.
        
        The original Rock Island Arsenal XM231 fired from an open bolt, giving the weapon an incredible rate of fire, at 1050 RPM (Rounds Per Minute). After Colt received the design, a special buffer and spring assembly limited the rate of fire to 200 RPM, thereby eliminating the risk that users would expend their ammunition before their weapon was brought to target.
        
        At some point during development, the weapon's fire rate was reintroduced at the 1100-1200 RPM range.
        
        Officially, the M231 is not to be detached from its parent vehicle unless in an emergency, and the operator's manual warns of precautions that would have to be taken when using the weapon outside the vehicle. In-game, these rules are ignored.
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The M231 is a powerful, fast-firing, high recoil assault rifle. Damage is quite good for its class, being capable of eliminating a target with a three-shot kill (3SK) to the body within 100 studs. Beyond this range, the M231 will 4SK to the body, however, it will always eliminate a full health enemy with three headshots, unless using certain suppressors. The range is fairly good, given the higher damage overall. Muzzle velocity is less-than-average, however, at just 2200 studs per second. However, as stated later, this is somewhat difficult to apply effectively.
        
        Rate of fire (RoF) is extremely high, at 1225 RPM—the fastest firing fully-automatic assault rifle in-game. Paired with the good damage, the weapon's time to kill (TTK) is extremely quick at all ranges, provided the user manages to hit all shots consistently. Recoil is as equally as high, however, with the weapon kicking quite high vertically with some horizontal movement. Due to this, the effective range is reduced. Furthermore, the high RoF means the weapon has very little time to return back to the user's original aiming position, meaning holding down the trigger will make a user's aim easily drift above an enemy's head. Per shot recoil is moderate, however, making tap-firing or burst-firing useful to limit the impact of recoil. Even with the usage of recoil-reducing attachments, some may struggle with the recoil.
        
        Uniquely, the M231 lacks proper iron sights. This makes aiming and subsequently controlling recoil whilst aiming-down-sights (ADS) quite difficult as a visual representation of the user's point-of-aim is not present. Muzzle flash is also quite high, making target acquisition whilst firing without attachments quite difficult.
        
        Magazine capacity is standard for an assault rifle, at 30 rounds, being unable to chamber an extra round. Interestingly, the M231 has 150 rounds in reserve than the regular 120 rounds of an assault rifle, resulting in having more total ammunition than any other assault rifle. Given the very high fire rate and subsequently very high ammunition consumption rate, the extra 30 rounds is beneficial. The M231 also benefits from having a common ammunition type, meaning that replenishing ammunition is fairly easy to do.
        
        Usage & Tactics
        Given the lack of a proper iron sight, an optic is a necessity for accurate shot placement. Low magnification optics such as the Reflex Sight or AMT-Terminator are good choices, as their low magnification lessens the impact of the visual recoil. As well as this, these sights also have small housing frames, meaning they are less obstructive when either aiming down sights (ADS) or hipfiring. However, which sight is chosen is subject to a user's preference. High magnification optics tend to exacerbate the high recoil, making them unsuited for the M231, especially when firing in full-auto. With tap-firing it is possible to utilize high magnification optics—the high minimum damage allowing for fairly good long-range performance—although this does require a high degree of skill from the user.
        
        Recoil-reducing attachments help to somewhat mitigate the extreme recoil of the M231, but M231 is incredibly demanding on a user's ability to effectively control the recoil. Burst-firing and tap-firing are essential for engagements outside of CQC and also conserving ammunition. Full-auto should be restricted to CQC. Regarding grips, the use of an Angled, Stubby or even Folding Grip can somewhat help in taming the recoil, but the M231 remains a difficult weapon to control in fully-automatic fire, even occasionally in close-quarters-combat (CQC). If one was less focused on precision, the Vertical Grip offers an alternative to those looking for a more aggressive class build, designed for spraying from the hip.
        
        Regarding barrel recoil-reducing attachments, they are less effective. The Muzzle Brake is the most effective out of the two, lowering the high vertical recoil, but the high degree of muzzle flash makes the need for either a suppressor or flash hider paramount. The compensator can be useful if the user wants to reduce the horizontal recoil. Grips remain more effective in reducing recoil in comparison, and so a user can forgo the use of a recoil-reducing barrel attachment with only a minimal difference in performance, in favor of a more useful option in regards to view on target.
        
        The Flash Hider is a great option for those seeking the removal of muzzle flash without the downsides of using a suppressor. Although it will make the weapon less stable. 
        
        Suppressors both remove the muzzle flash and keep the user off of the minimap whilst firing, both beneficial traits to possess, the latter particularly useful in CQC. Depending on the suppressor, the penalty to damage, range and muzzle velocity varies. Some preserve the 3SK up close at the cost of steeper damage drop-off or worse minimum damage; resulting in a 5SK at long range, whereas others heavily hamper muzzle velocity and worsen the weapon's long-range performance. However, given the very high RoF and CQC power of the M231, the negative impacts on minimum damage and muzzle velocity are somewhat negated by the benefits of using a suppressor.
        
        In regards to attachments from the Other category, lasers are valuable to any class build—improving hipfire performance by providing a visual indication of where bullets will land when firing when not ADS. Attachments such as the Canted Sights can work when paired with a high-magnification optic such as the ACOG Scope, although such a pairing is not as effective given the high recoil. The Ballistics Tracker is largely ineffective given the CQC nature of the weapon. The wire stock can help with recoil to some degree but is generally unsatisfactory as the user has to sacrifice either a Laser or grip to accommodate it. One workaround is by using the MARS or AMT-Terminator sight for its integrated laser. Should the user want to reduce recoil even further, the choice of .223 Remington ammo is also available, reducing recoil at the cost of damage and velocity.
        
        Conclusion
        The M231 is a CQC oriented weapon. With the damage of an assault rifle and the RoF of a PDW, it can be quite powerful once the user has mastered the recoil. It's fast reload speed can be handy, especially when the magazine is expended due to its fast RoF. Provided with good recoil control and the right attachments, the M231 can be a powerful weapon.</li> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox-phantom-forces/images/0/0c/M231_angled.png/revision/latest?cb=20181017181805" width=500 height=300>

    <li>L85A2. History
        The L85A2 is a British bullpup assault rifle configured for the 5.56×45mm NATO round. It is part of the British SA80 (Small Arms for the 1980s) rifle family and is the last in the extremely long line of British weapons (including the iconic Lee-Enfield family) produced by the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield.
        
        Produced from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, the L85 rifles include a slotted flash suppressor (not included in-game), which serves as a mounting point for attaching and launching rifle grenades, a blank-firing adapter (Used In Combat Training), an optic mounting system for a carry handle or the standard SUSAT (Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux) or various other optics with adapter mount. Additionally, a 40mm under-barrel grenade launcher can be attached to this rifle. There were many modifications to this weapon since its introduction, and currently two variants, the L22 carbine and L86 LSW, which are both featured in-game.
        
        The L85A2's predecessor, the L85A1, had multiple problems with accuracy, reliability, the lack of an ambidextrous firing port, and poor quality control. After a substantial public outcry, hundreds of thousands of the L85A1s were shipped to Heckler & Koch to be improved. H&K was able to fix most of the problems with the rifles. Those upgraded by H&K were designated the L85A2, and remain the standard British service rifle to this day. As of 2018, these rifles are being upgraded once more by H&K to L85A3s.
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The L85A2 is, at most, a four-shot kill (4SK) to a target at any range, having one of the highest mininum damage values for an assault rifle. Its recoil is a mixed amount of moderate vertical recoil and high horizontal recoil, though it is controllable with attachments. The L85A2's rate of fire (RoF) is 700 rounds per minute (RPM), which is average for its class—this allows it to not expend ammunition too quickly, with a decent tactical reload, but a slow empty reload.
        
        Usage & Tactics
        The L85A2 is not a weapon oriented for close-quarters-combat (CQC)—its RoF is not as high as the AS VAL or FAMAS G2, and only dealing a 4SK makes the time to kill (TTK) up close somewhat mediocre, being on par with the AK12. However, at medium to longer ranges, the L85 shines in being able to deal a 4SK at any range, rivaling some designated marksman rifles and light machine guns. It can become a pseudo-DMR with the advantage of being able to fire in full-auto, however, spraying down targets at long range is likely to result in a large amount of ammunition being wasted. Tap-firing is more effective at such distances, and being able to fire faster than most DMRs on semi-auto does give it an edge, albeit the slower muzzle velocity means that DMRs are likely to outclass it at very long distances.
        
        As mentioned above, the L85A2 has some significant horizontal recoil. A Compensator is rather helpful in mitigating the horizontal recoil, making the weapon more accurate and easier to control. This allows the L85A2 to be fired in fully-automatic at longer ranges and still remain on target. The default suppressor is also a decent choice for stealth builds, given there is no reduction in the shots to kill (STK) at any distance, although at longer ranges the reduced muzzle velocity will hamper the L85's effectiveness.
        
        It is best to avoid, or at least minimize CQC, given the mediocre TTK of the weapon. If unavoidable, a secondary ideal for CQC such as the TEC-9 is helpful to have, giving the user the ability to compete in closer-ranged gunfights. It is certainly possible to outplay the enemy in CQC with the L85A2, but staying at medium range with the L85A2 will yield better results, as most weapons begin to experience their damage drop-off at such distances.
        
        Conclusion
        The L85A2 is an all-rounder weapon, despite its average CQC performance and moderate overall recoil without attachments. Furthermore, it can take on some DMRs in mid-range combat, and outranges many of its class.</li> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox-phantom-forces/images/1/18/L85A2_angled.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20190205025128" width=500 height=300>

    <li>G36. History
        In 1990, Heckler and Koch (H&K) began working on a new 5.56×45mm NATO Assault Rifle, to replace the larger-caliber G3 battle rifle. The rifle was designed from the ground up and was designated "Project 50" or HK50. The prototype was trialed against the Austrian Steyr AUG, where it was rated better. The weapon was finalized in 1995, with production commencing a year later. The HK50 rifle was adopted by the German Bundeswehr in 1997 as its standard-issue rifle, under the designation Gewehr 36, or G36.
        
        Multiple variants were derived from the original G36. Notable variants include the G36C, a sub-carbine variant and the MG36, a light machine gun variant which features a heavier barrel, bipod, and 100-round Beta C magazine.[1]
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The G36 is a long range oriented assault rifle, possessing a balance between firepower, recoil control while aiming, rate of fire and range. However, the camera recoil is bouncy and the hip fire leaves much to be desired with its tendency to sway away from targets. The G36 has and retains a 4-shot kill (4SK) at all ranges and a high muzzle velocity, similar to the L85A2. This lets it function as a faster firing alternative to something like a designated marksman rifle.
        
        While aiming, the initial recoil has a strong bounce to it. In fully automatic fire, it will make the gun rise up quite a bit, then hold stable after the third shot. Despite beginning with a strong kick, the recoil recovery of the G36 is quite fast, as even rapid tap fire is accurate enough to hit enemies with ease up to 150 studs. The hip fire, however, is the complete opposite. The recoil is random, uncontrollable and spread in a wide pattern, even worse than some 7.62 NATO assault rifles and the battle rifles. The recoil is similar to the M60 in that the weapon will begin to pivot off target under sustained fire.
        
        Usage & Tactics
        While using the G36, one should keep in mind that it does not particularly excel at short range, but performs better at medium and long ranges. Due to this, close-quarters-combat (CQC) is not recommended with the G36. It would be preferable to switch to a secondary weapon in case such a situation arises. On the other hand, the G36's sway may come in handy when dealing with more than one hostile at close range, as the G36 will naturally sweep slowly in one direction before turning around back to the other direction with a sharp flick. Unfortunately, not even the vertical grip can do much to temper the poor hipfire performance.
        
        Remember that the G36 shines at longer ranges where it has room to breathe. At its practical range, one can use its high muzzle velocity combined with its fast fire rate to rapidly pick out enemies one by one, much like a DMR. Recoil constraining attachments are always welcome while aiming. However, be aware that even with recoil constraining attachments, the G36 still lacks some stability, meaning that it may sway off target at distance. Remember to tap-fire with caution, even if it exposes the G36's strong initial recoil forces.
        
        Conclusion
        The G36 is a gun tailored for long range engagement, capable of heavily suppressing skilled snipers where other assault rifles cannot. Despite all of its long range boons however, in stock form, the G36 has unfavorable recoil for the job, and lacks hipfire stability in general, making it a poor candidate for close range cleanup without a tactical advantage on the user's part.</li> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox-phantom-forces/images/1/12/G36_angled.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20191008025619" width=500 height=300>

    <li>AK47. History
        The AK47 (Russian: Aвтома́т Kала́шникова 1947 or Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947) is a gas-operated, rotating bolt assault rifle designed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. The design of the AK47 began in 1945. Mikhail Kalashnikov and his team sought to create an automatic rifle that would replace the Mosin Nagant and various submachine guns in active Soviet military service as a standard infantry weapon. The AK47 incorporated and shares design elements from the German Sturmgewehr-44 (STG-44), one of the first true modern-day assault rifles. Both rifles feature select-fire capabilities, feed from a 30-round curved box magazine, and are both chambered for intermediate cartridges.
        
        The AK47 was chambered in the then newly developed Soviet 7.62×39mm round—an intermediate cartridge that took influence from the German 7.92×33mm Kurz round used in the STG-44. This caliber was first used in the RPD and SKS. It was designed to be a compromise between the full-sized 7.62×54mmR rifle round and smaller 7.62×25mm Tokarev round used in pistols and submachine guns. In 1946, the AK47 was presented for official military trials. In 1948, fixed stock versions were introduced to select units of the Red Army, and in 1949, it was officially issued to the Red Army.
        
        The AK47 was designed to be a simple, reliable and durable automatic rifle that could be manufactured in large quantities at a relatively low price. Its robust design allows it to endure large amounts of debris and fouling without causing malfunction or needed complex maintenance. For these reasons, the AK47 has seen service in countless conflicts around the world, used by armies and irregular forces alike, and continues to be manufactured today by various companies around the world.
        
        In 1959, the AK47 was replaced by the AKM as the standard service rifle in the Red Army. While the weapons are no longer in service with current Russian forces, they are still used by police, militia, prison guards, etc., and can commonly be found on the second-hand market.
        
        In-Game
        General Information
        The AK47 is a risk, reward assault rifle. It sports very powerful damage, dealing the highest amount damage at close range out of all the assault rifles, with a three-shot kill (3SK) anywhere to the body within its maximum damage range. It can two-shot kill with a headshot and a limb shot up to 80 studs. Within its maximum damage range, it can also deliver a 2SK with one headshot, the only assault rifle capable of doing so. However, it also has very high recoil, making it especially difficult to control in fully-automatic fire. It also has a low RoF, firing at 600 RPM—behind many of the modern assault rifles in its category.
        
        The range is good, with its 3SK lasting past 100 studs. Muzzle velocity is below-average, at 2000 studs/s. However, due to the high damage, the time to kill (TTK) of the AK47 remains quite low at all ranges. The AK47 also boasts good penetration.
        
        Usage & Tactics
        Attachments such as the Muzzle Brake and the Angled Grip are highly recommended to improve the weapon's handling, given its high recoil, but, there is another option, using the Stubby Grip to greatly reduce the Gun/ADS recoil to a near minimum. It also has a high amount of muzzle flash, so a Flash Hider can be useful.
        
        Shot placement is key with the AK47. As stated before, it is the only assault rifle that can two-shot with a single headshot. Its high vertical recoil can actually assist with this; with practice, a user could easily aim for the torso and let the second shot kick up into the enemy's head. This 'varying shot placement' (due to recoil) feature common among LMGs means the user can be slightly less conservative about perfect shot placement, though the lower ROF on the weapon means a user must take caution when attacking an enemy.
        
        When used in semi-automatic mode and with select optics, the AK47 can be used as a pseudo-designated marksman rifle, behaving similarly to the SKS. At long range, landing headshots can reduce the shots to kill (STK) from four to three. Combined with its high maximum damage, the AK47 can perform competitively at any range. Although, it does have a lower than average muzzle velocity, so at longer ranges, one must lean their shots more in order to hit their targets.
        
        For a hybrid approach, a high power optic (such as the VCOG 6x Scope, PKA-S, and ACOG Scope) can be equipped alongside a range of grips and laser sights. These attachments are used by using the high power optic when a target is spotted at longer ranges, and hip firing in close-quarters-combat (CQC). But, if you want to be on the aggressive, it is best to use a Coyote Sight or a Reflex Sight due to it being a low-power-optic. Optics such as the MARS which are mounted higher on the weapon can help to compensate for the weapon's vertical recoil and camera recoil.
        
        Conclusion
        The AK47 is a gun that combines both the range and power of a DMR with the magazine size and RoF of an assault rifle. The combination of these two traits makes the AK47 a force to be reckoned with, both in CQC and long-range. The recoil and lower rate of fire, however, must be taken into account when using the weapon, as they make the weapon more difficult to tame than other Assault Rifles.</li> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox-phantom-forces/images/9/96/AK47_angled.png/revision/latest?cb=20190205025127" width=500 height=300>
